**Exercise 3.23:** A _deque_ (“double-ended queue”) is a sequence in which items can be inserted and deleted at either the front or the rear. Operations on deques are the constructor `make-deque`, the predicate `empty-deque?`, selectors `front-deque` and `rear-deque`, mutators `front-insert-deque!`, `rear-insert-deque!`, `front-delete-deque!`, and `rear-delete-deque!`. Show how to represent deques using pairs, and
give implementations of the operations.* All operations should be accomplished in Θ(1) steps.
_* Be careful not to make the interpreter try to print a structure that contains cycles._
